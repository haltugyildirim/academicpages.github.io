I am interested in experimental solid state physics and related instrumentation. Currently I am in my course phase of my master studies. The courses I took in this semester are:

* Advanced Laboratory Course for Master Students
* Advanced Statistical Physics II
* Computer Tutorial in Markov Modeling

You can find some related research that I done in my bachelor from research menu. If you would like to know more about me, just go over my book list and shamelessly non-updated blog and drawing portfolio!
