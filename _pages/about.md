I am interested in experimental solid state physics and related instrumentation. Currently I am in course phase of my master studies.

You can find some related research that I done in my bachelor from research menu. Also you can find the information about the courses that I took during my studies. If you would like to know more about me, just go over my book list and shamelessly non-updated blog and drawing portfolio!
