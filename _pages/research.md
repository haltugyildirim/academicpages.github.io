* Python script for data analysis in Angle-resolved time-of-flight photoemission experiments can be found [*here*](https://github.com/haltugyildirim/ARTOF-Data-Analysis)
* [*Here*](http://haltugyildirim.github.io/images/pcb_layout_example.png) you can find an example of a PCB schematic that I designed.
* A white paper dealing with Lock-in theory for STS:
  * [*Lock-in Theory for Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy*](http://haltugyildirim.github.io/files/lock-in/lock-in.pdf)
* An example of a crystal holder design in CAD software for an UHV system can be seen in [*here*](http://haltugyildirim.github.io/images/crystal_holder_example.jpg)
* Another example of a CAD design for a linear actuator to move a crystal holder back and forth on optical breadboard:
